# Digit Detector and Image Matcher Project 
This is a project for CSC420: Introduction to Image Understanding. 
Part 1: Implemented a digit detector from sample digits to detect digits on a test image with convolution and non-maximum suppression.
Part 2: Implemented Harris Corner Detection and SIFT algorithm with Matlab to identify interest points of two images, calculate their descriptors and match boundaries of same objects by computing affine transform matrix
